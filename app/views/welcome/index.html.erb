    Welcome to the personal portfolio for Peter Haugen, full stack developer, itinerant physicist and semi-periodic humorist. Visiting the Projects page you'll see an assortment of explorations in mainly physics and math but don't be surprised if more finds it's way in there.

    My CV and social network information is also available in the top bar. For the aggressively curious I have a aperiodically updated blog where I jot down long form thoughts that might need to be aired out in the light of day.

    Finally, maybe I'm not entirely what you had in mind? I've made a number of impressive collaborators over the years and maybe one of them will pique your interest.
